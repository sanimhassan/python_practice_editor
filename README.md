# Python Practice Web Application

A web-based Python learning platform that allows students to practice Python programming directly in the browser.

## Description

This project combines elements from both local and remote repositories, providing a web-based Python learning platform.

## Features

### Basic Mode (Skulpt)
- Interactive Python code editor with syntax highlighting
- Real-time code execution using Skulpt
- Line numbers and proper code indentation
- Exercise library with examples for different Python concepts
- Hints and example code for learning assistance

### Advanced Mode (Pyodide) - Coming Soon
- Full Python 3 support with Pyodide
- Access to Python packages and libraries
- Advanced code execution capabilities

## UI/UX Improvements

The application features a modern, user-friendly interface with:

- Clean, responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Intuitive navigation with tabbed interface
- Exercise sidebar with categorized learning content
- Code editor with line numbers and proper indentation
- Syntax highlighting for better code readability
- Dark-themed output console for better visibility
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Tooltips for improved usability
- Accessibility improvements for all users

## Technical Notes

### Skulpt Limitations
- Skulpt is a JavaScript implementation of Python that runs in the browser
- It supports most Python 2.x features but has limited Python 3 support
- F-strings and some other Python 3 features are not supported
- For full Python 3 support, the Advanced mode will use Pyodide (WebAssembly-based Python)

### Files Structure
- `index.html` - Original HTML file
- `enhanced-index.html` - Enhanced version with improved UI/UX
- `css/styles.css` - Original CSS styles
- `css/enhanced-styles.css` - Enhanced CSS with modern design
- `js/main.js` - Main JavaScript functionality
- `js/skulpt-setup.js` - Skulpt Python interpreter setup
- `js/skulpt-completion.js` - Code completion functionality
- `js/enhanced-ui.js` - Enhanced UI interactions and features

## How to Use

1. Open `enhanced-index.html` in a web browser to use the enhanced version
2. Select an exercise from the sidebar
3. Write or modify Python code in the editor
4. Click "Run Code" to execute the Python code
5. View the output in the console below the editor
6. Use the toolbar for additional features:
   - Select examples from the dropdown
   - Get hints for the current exercise
   - Reset code to the default example
   - Clear the output console

## Future Improvements

- Implement the Advanced mode with Pyodide for full Python 3 support
- Add more exercises and examples
- Implement user authentication and progress tracking
- Add code sharing and export functionality
- Implement a more sophisticated code editor with full syntax highlighting
- Add unit tests for exercises to verify solutions
